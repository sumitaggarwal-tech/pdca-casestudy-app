Q#,Type,Question,Options/Answer Key,Rationale
1,MCSR,"In the Starbucks case, what was the PRIMARY purpose of using the Fishbone (Ishikawa) Diagram in the PLAN phase?",A) To calculate wait time statistics|B) To systematically identify potential root causes across multiple categories|C) To train baristas on new procedures|D) To design the order sequencing algorithm,B - Fishbone diagrams organize potential causes into categories (6Ms) to ensure comprehensive root cause identification
2,MCSR,Why did Starbucks use Pareto Analysis in combination with the Fishbone Diagram?,A) Because it's required by PDCA methodology|B) To prioritize which root causes contribute most significantly to the problem|C) To reduce the cost of implementation|D) To satisfy customer demands,"B - Pareto (80/20 rule) helps prioritize the 'vital few' causes that create the most impact, allowing focused resource allocation"
3,MCSR,The 5 Whys technique used by Starbucks helped achieve which specific outcome?,A) Improved barista morale|B) Identified the fundamental root cause: lack of intelligent order sequencing system|C) Reduced menu complexity|D) Increased store traffic,"B - 5 Whys drills down through symptoms to find the underlying systemic root cause, not just surface-level issues"
4,MCSR,In which PDCA phase was the order sequencing algorithm actually implemented at pilot stores?,A) PLAN|B) DO|C) CHECK|D) ACT,B - DO phase is where planned solutions are tested/implemented on a small scale before full deployment
5,MCSR,What was the strategic purpose of implementing the solution at 700 pilot stores before company-wide rollout?,"A) To reduce costs|B) To test the solution in real conditions, gather data, and refine before full deployment|C) To train all baristas simultaneously|D) To meet regulatory requirements","B - Pilot testing (DO phase) validates assumptions, identifies issues, and allows refinement before investing in full-scale implementation"
6,MCSR,Which quality tool was MOST critical for monitoring whether the improvements were sustained over time?,A) Fishbone Diagram|B) Pareto Chart|C) Control Charts and Statistical Process Control|D) 5 Whys,"C - Control charts monitor process performance over time, detecting variation and ensuring improvements are maintained"
7,MCSR,"Why did Starbucks use MULTIPLE quality tools (Fishbone, 5 Whys, Pareto) rather than just one?",A) To make the project more complex|B) Each tool serves a different analytical purpose - comprehensive analysis requires multiple perspectives|C) To increase project duration|D) Company policy required it,"B - Each tool provides different insights: Fishbone (comprehensive cause identification), 5 Whys (depth), Pareto (prioritization)"
8,MCSR,What is the primary reason Starbucks established the 4-minute service goal in the PLAN phase before implementation?,"A) Competitor benchmarking|B) To provide a clear, measurable target for evaluating success in the CHECK phase|C) To motivate employees|D) To attract investors",B - SMART goals in PLAN phase create measurable criteria for objective evaluation in CHECK phase
9,MCSR,The CHECK phase analysis showed 75% of orders met the 4-minute target. What was the appropriate ACT phase response?,A) Stop the project as 100% wasn't achieved|B) Standardize the successful process company-wide and plan continuous improvement for remaining gaps|C) Return to the original process|D) Immediately implement at all stores without analysis,B - ACT phase standardizes successful improvements and initiates new PDCA cycles for remaining opportunities
10,MCSR,How did Process Flow Mapping contribute differently than the Fishbone Diagram in this case?,A) They serve the same purpose|B) Flow mapping visualizes the sequential workflow and identifies bottlenecks; Fishbone categorizes potential causes|C) Flow mapping is used in CHECK phase only|D) Flow mapping replaces the need for other tools,B - Process Flow Mapping shows the sequence and flow of activities to identify bottlenecks; Fishbone categorizes causes by type
11,True/False,The PDCA cycle ends after the ACT phase is completed and standardization is achieved.,FALSE,"FALSE - PDCA is a continuous improvement cycle. After ACT, new opportunities identified lead to new PLAN phases, creating ongoing improvement"
12,True/False,Using data-driven tools like Pareto Charts makes decision-making more objective by quantifying which problems have the greatest impact.,TRUE,TRUE - Quantitative analysis removes subjectivity and ensures resources are allocated to highest-impact issues based on data
13,True/False,The primary purpose of the DO phase pilot test is to immediately implement the solution company-wide.,FALSE,FALSE - DO phase pilots test solutions on small scale to validate effectiveness and identify issues before full deployment
14,Subjective,Explain why Starbucks needed to use BOTH the CHECK phase measurement (analyzing results) AND the ACT phase (standardization) rather than jumping directly from implementation (DO) to standardization.,Expected elements: CHECK phase validates whether solution actually works through data analysis; ACT phase applies learnings; premature standardization without validation risks institutionalizing ineffective solutions; CHECK identifies what works/doesn't work; ACT standardizes successes and addresses gaps; data-driven decision making requires evidence before full commitment,"Complete answer should address: importance of validation, risk of premature standardization, data-driven approach, learning from results, identifying gaps before full rollout"
15,Subjective,"Describe how the combination of Fishbone Diagram, 5 Whys, and Pareto Chart provided more comprehensive problem analysis than any single tool could have provided in the Starbucks case.",Expected elements: Fishbone provides breadth (comprehensive cause identification across 6M categories); 5 Whys provides depth (drilling to root cause); Pareto provides prioritization (identifying vital few); using all three ensures comprehensive identification + deep understanding + focused action; single tool misses critical dimensions; integration of tools creates robust analysis,"Complete answer should address: unique contribution of each tool, breadth vs depth vs prioritization, complementary nature, comprehensive analysis benefits, limitations of single-tool approach"
